A web-based Library Management System where librarians manage all library data and students log in using email and enrollment number to view issued books, issue dates, due dates, and renewal countdowns.

Problem statement:
Smart Digital Library Management Systems still face several challenges such as manual record keeping, difficulty in tracking issued books, delays in book submission, lack of automated reminders, and limited access for students to view their library records. These limitations often lead to data mismanagement, increased workload for librarians, and students missing due dates due to the absence of timely notifications.
Additionally, another major problem occurs when students exchange books among friends. Even though the books may appear identical, each copy has a unique Book ID. Most students are unaware of their specific Book ID, so when books are exchanged, they often return the wrong copy, which does not match the one originally issued to them. This leads to confusion during the return process, incorrect record mapping, difficulty in identifying the actual borrower, and further complications in maintaining accurate library data.

Solution :
The proposed solution is Smart Digital Library Management System designed to digitalize and streamline library operations. It enables the librarian to efficiently manage student records, maintain book details, issue and return books, and track borrowing activities without manual effort. Students can register using their Name ,Email and enrollment number and access a personal dashboard where they can clearly see which books are issued to them, along with the issue date, due date,  fine and remaining days. The system automatically follows a 30-day borrowing period and provides countdown reminders and alert notifications to ensure students return or renew books on time and avoid fines after the 30-days limit.
To effectively solve the problem of book confusion and swapping, each physical copy of a book is assigned a unique Book ID that acts as its digital identity. Even if multiple students have the same book title and exchange books with friends, and even if they do not know which exact copy belongs to them, the system can still precisely recognize the originally issued book using this unique Book ID. This ensures accurate tracking, prevents incorrect returns, eliminating confusion during returns., and maintains complete accountability for every book copy in the library.
This solution ensures precise data handling, reduces workload, prevents delays and fines, and makes the library system smarter, more transparent, and highly user-friendly.
